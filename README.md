## Introduction
I'm an economics student transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam.

Although I'm at the beginning of my journey, I’m highly motivated to keep learning and build hands-on skills in this fast-evolving industry. I'm especially interested in cybersecurity fundamentals, threat analysis, and security operations.

🔐 Always curious. Always growing.

💻 Open to collaborations, internships, and learning opportunities in the cybersecurity space.
